# shortQuiz
This is the coding quiz for homework # 4

AS A coding bootcamp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the link, the site will open the index.html file first.  
- On that page there is a big image that will take you to the beginQuiz.html page and will start the quiz.
- The instructions for starting the quiz and what to expect are also listed in the index.html page
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
- The beginQuiz.html page is where all the quiz related questions, time keeping and progress bars are shown.
WHEN I answer a question
- Below the questions, you have constant counter of your current scorecard.
- Once the user clicks an answer, the next question will follow until you answer all 6 questions.
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over and you can save your initials and score if you have a top 10 score
- After you answer all 6 questions or  you run out of time, the page will ask for your initials to report your score and time.
WHEN the game is over
- Below your score, you can see the scores for others in the top 10. This top ten list is stored on the local storage and if you get in there, it will   displace the lowest ranked person. 

```

The HTML pages were built mostly using Bootstrap and can adjust automatically to screen width. 
The javaScript code contains very descriptive function names to make the code easy to follow and the names of the objects and variables are also reflective of what they do.  For any unique and not so straightforward tasks, notes have been made on the code to describe what it is happening.
