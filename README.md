This is the coding quiz for homework # 4

This homework challenged me greatly and I had a lot of struggles with it that I had to overcome.  I have now succeeded in making it look and act the way I wanted and to meet all the requirements.

Overall, the project has met all the assignment requirements.  In addition to the requirements, the formatting is very elegant.

The HTML pages were built mostly using Bootstrap and can adjust automatically to screen width. 

The site will open the index.html file first.  
- On that page there is a big image that will take you to the beginQuiz.html page and will start the quiz.
- The instructions for starting the quiz and what to expect are also listed in the index.html page

The beginQuiz.html page is where all the quiz related questions, time keeping and progress bars are shown.
Below the questions, you have constant counter of your current scorecard.
Once the user clicks an answer, the next question will follow until you answer all 6 questions.
After you answer all 6 questions or  you run out of time, the page will ask for your initials to report your score and time.
Below your score, you can see the scores for others in the top 10. This top ten list is stored on the local storage and if you get in there, it will displace the lowest ranked person.  

The javaScript code contains very descriptive function names to make the code easy to follow and the names of the objects and variables are also reflective of what
they do.  For any unique and not so straightforward tasks, notes have been made on the code to describe what it is happening.
